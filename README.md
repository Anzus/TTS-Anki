# Caveats

Please do not bother the Talk The Streets team for support on these decks. I created the decks for my own use, and I'm making them available to other students. The best way to use these decks is **not** to  download them and use them as-is, but to modify the decks so they have meaning to you. For example, the image I've chosen for "sozinho" works for me, but might not for you.

Wherever possible I've used an image for the back of the card, not a translation. The idea is to learn the **meaning** of the word, not the translation.

I welcome suggestions for changes.
